# Product Context - Toronto Mega Empires Website

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem We Solve

**The Challenge:** Mega Empires is an incredible gaming experience - a 12-hour epic strategy game supporting up to 18 players - but it faces significant barriers to community growth:

1. **Discovery Problem:** Potential players don't know this amazing game exists or where to find local communities
2. **Intimidation Factor:** The game's complexity and time commitment can seem overwhelming to newcomers
3. **Coordination Complexity:** Organizing 9-18 player events requires significant logistics and communication
4. **Community Fragmentation:** Players are scattered across different platforms without a central hub

### Our Solution

The Toronto Mega Empires website serves as the **central community hub** that:
- Makes the game discoverable and approachable for newcomers
- Provides clear pathways to join the community and attend events
- Centralizes event coordination and communication
- Showcases the social, epic nature of the gaming experience
- Builds a welcoming, inclusive community around this legendary game
