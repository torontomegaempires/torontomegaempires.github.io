## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Design Philosophy

- **Mobile-Responsive:** Ensure excellent experience across all device types
- **Performance-Conscious:** Keep loading times fast while enhancing visual appeal

### Technical Approach
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Build solid foundation, enhance with advanced features
- **Component-Based CSS:** Maintain modular, reusable styling system

- **Static Site Benefits:** Leverage Jekyll's speed, security, and simplicity

### Content Strategy
- **Newcomer Focus:** Always consider the new player experience in content decisions
- **Social Proof:** Showcase active, welcoming community through photos and stories
- **Clear Pathways:** Provide obvious next steps for engagement at every stage
- **Historical Record:** Maintain comprehensive record of community achievements

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### CSS Architecture Patterns
```scss
// Component naming convention
.component-name {
  // Base styles
  &-modifier { /* Modifier styles */ }
  &-element { /* Child element styles */ }
}

// Consistent spacing and sizing
:root {
  --brand-color: #f2cb05;
  --text-dark: #2c3e50;
  --border-radius: 8px;
  --shadow-subtle: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
}
```

### Content Structure Patterns
- **Card-Based Layouts:** Consistent card components for information presentation
- **Icon + Text Combinations:** Emoji icons with descriptive text for visual hierarchy
- **Callout Boxes:** Structured information highlighting with consistent styling
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Layer information complexity appropriately

### Animation and Interaction Patterns
- **Subtle Motion:** Purposeful animations that enhance without distracting
- **Hover Effects:** Consistent transform and shadow effects on interactive elements
- **Performance-Optimized:** Use transform/opacity for smooth 60fps animations
- **Accessibility-Conscious:** Respect user preferences for reduced motion

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technical Learnings
- **Jekyll Liquid Templating:** Complex nested HTML structures can cause issues; JavaScript onclick events are more reliable than complex link structures
- **CSS Pointer Events:** `pointer-events: none` completely blocks click functionality; use carefully
- **HTML Structure Validation:** Malformed nested divs interfere with link functionality
- **Background Image Integration:** Multi-layer backgrounds with gradients create professional, cinematic effects

### Design Insights
- **Visual Impact:** Dramatic background images with proper overlays create immediate engagement
- **Glass-morphism Effects:** Translucent cards with backdrop blur provide modern, premium feel
- **Typography Hierarchy:** Large, glowing text with proper contrast ensures readability and impact
- **Interactive Feedback:** Hover effects and animations encourage user engagement

### Community Understanding
- **Newcomer Concerns:** Time commitment and complexity are primary barriers to entry
- **Social Proof Importance:** Photos and community stories build confidence in newcomers
- **Multiple Pathways:** Different people prefer different ways to engage (Discord, email, Facebook)
- **Event Variety:** Home games, conventions, and MiniCons serve different community needs

## Current Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Balancing Epic Scale with Approachability
**Solution:** Use visual grandeur (background images, animations) while maintaining clear, welcoming copy and obvious next steps for newcomers.

### Challenge: Mobile Performance with Rich Visual Content
**Solution:** Optimize images, use efficient CSS animations, and implement progressive enhancement for mobile users.

### Challenge: Single Maintainer Sustainability
**Solution:** Focus on maintainable, well-documented code patterns and leverage static site benefits for minimal ongoing maintenance.

### Challenge: Community Growth Without Losing Intimacy
**Solution:** Showcase both epic scale (18-player games) and intimate community aspects (home games, personal stories).
