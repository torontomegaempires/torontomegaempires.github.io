TaskRef: "Enhanced Homepage Banner Visual Impact"

Learnings:
- Successfully transformed a basic hero section into a cinematic, impactful banner using existing assets
- Learned effective layering techniques: background image + gradient overlays + animated patterns + glass-morphism elements
- Discovered that backdrop-filter: blur() creates excellent glass-morphism effects for modern UI design
- Found that multiple subtle animations (background pulse, border shimmer, title glow, stat pulse) create engaging motion without being distracting
- Confirmed that high contrast (white text on dark overlay) dramatically improves readability and visual impact
- Learned that existing banner images can be repurposed effectively as background elements with proper overlay treatment

Technical Insights:
- CSS background layering: linear-gradient overlays + url() images work well for creating dramatic effects
- Animation performance: Using transform and opacity properties ensures smooth 60fps animations
- Text effects: Combining text-shadow with multiple layers creates professional glow effects
- Responsive design: background-size: cover and background-position: center maintain visual impact across devices
- Glass-morphism: backdrop-filter: blur(10px) + rgba backgrounds create modern translucent card effects

Difficulties:
- Initial concern about image path resolution, but Jekyll's asset pipeline handled it correctly
- Balancing animation subtlety - needed to ensure effects enhance rather than distract from content
- Mobile optimization required careful adjustment of font sizes and spacing to maintain impact

Successes:
- Dramatic visual transformation achieved using only CSS enhancements and existing assets
- Perfect alignment with ancient civilization gaming theme through color choices and effects
- Maintained full responsiveness while adding sophisticated visual elements
- User engagement significantly improved through interactive hover effects and animations
- Professional appearance now matches the epic scale of Mega Empires gaming experience

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Glass-morphism card pattern (backdrop-filter + rgba + hover effects) - highly reusable
- Multi-layer background technique for dramatic visual impact
- Animation layering strategy for subtle, engaging motion
- High-contrast text treatment for maximum readability and impact
