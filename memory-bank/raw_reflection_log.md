TaskRef: "Make social media links more prominent on Toronto Mega Empires website"

Learnings:
- Successfully implemented a prominent social media section using existing design patterns from the site
- Created two levels of social media link styling: prominent buttons for main sections and compact links for secondary placement
- Used the site's existing CSS framework and brand colors (#f2cb05) to maintain design consistency
- Implemented proper hover effects and animations that match the existing card styling patterns
- Added both Discord (discord.torontomegaempires.com) and Facebook (fb.torontomegaempires.com) links with appropriate branding colors
- Positioned the main social media section strategically right after the hero section for maximum visibility
- Used semantic HTML with proper accessibility attributes (target="_blank" for external links)

Technical Implementation:
- Added comprehensive CSS classes: .social-media-section, .social-button, .social-links-compact
- Used CSS gradients and hover effects consistent with existing game-type-card styling
- Implemented responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Added dark mode support for the new social media components
- Used proper CSS naming conventions and organization

Design Decisions:
- Placed prominent social media section immediately after hero section for maximum impact
- Used Discord blue (#5865f2) and Facebook blue (#1877f2) for brand recognition
- Maintained existing emoji-based iconography (ðŸ’¬ for Discord, ðŸ‘¥ for Facebook)
- Created two styling levels: prominent buttons and compact links for different contexts
- Used consistent border-radius, padding, and shadow patterns from existing components

Successes:
- Successfully integrated new components without disrupting existing design
