TaskRef: "Phase 1: Typography & Visual Hierarchy Enhancement for Toronto Mega Empires Website"

Learnings:
- Successfully implemented comprehensive CSS typography system with hero sections, callout boxes, game type cards, and section dividers
- Created responsive design patterns that work across desktop and mobile devices
- Established visual hierarchy using gradient text effects, animated elements, and consistent spacing
- Implemented modular CSS classes (.hero-section, .info-callout, .action-callout, .warning-callout, .game-type-card, .section-divider) for reusable components
- Used CSS animations (gradientShift, shimmer) to add visual interest without being distracting
- Applied consistent brand colors (#f2cb05 gold) throughout the design system
- Successfully restructured homepage content from plain text to visually engaging card-based layouts

Difficulties:
- Initial replace_in_file operation failed due to content mismatch - resolved by using smaller, more precise SEARCH blocks
- Had to work iteratively with multiple smaller replacements rather than large content blocks
- CRITICAL: Markdown HTML formatting issue - discovered that ALL HTML tags (both opening <div> and closing </div>) MUST start at column 0 with no indentation, otherwise Markdown parser treats them as code blocks instead of rendering them as HTML

Successes:
- Created a cohesive visual design system that maintains the ancient civilization theme
- Transformed static content into interactive, engaging visual elements
- Maintained all existing functionality while dramatically improving visual appeal
- Implemented proper responsive design for mobile users
- Added meaningful icons and visual cues throughout the content
- Successfully resolved Markdown HTML formatting issue ensuring proper rendering

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- CSS modular component system approach for consistent styling
- Iterative content replacement strategy for large files
- Visual hierarchy principles using gradients, spacing, and typography scales
- CRITICAL RULE: When writing HTML in Markdown files, ALL HTML tags must start at column 0 (no indentation) to ensure proper parsing and rendering
