## Jekyll & Liquid Templating Patterns

### Clickable Card Components
**Pattern:** For large clickable areas, JavaScript onclick events are more reliable than complex nested HTML link structures.

**Implementation:**
```html
<!-- Preferred: JavaScript onclick approach -->
<div class="card-component" onclick="window.open('https://example.com', '_blank')" style="cursor: pointer;">
  <!-- Complex nested content -->
</div>

<!-- Avoid: Complex nested <a> tag structures -->
<a href="https://example.com">
  <div class="complex-nested-content">
    <!-- Multiple nested divs can cause issues -->
  </div>
</a>
```

**Rationale:** Jekyll Liquid templating can have issues with complex nested HTML structures, especially when wrapping large blocks of content with `<a>` tags. JavaScript onclick provides more reliable functionality.

### HTML Structure Validation
**Pattern:** Always validate HTML structure when working with Jekyll templating, as malformed nested divs can interfere with link functionality.

**Best Practices:**
- Ensure all opening tags have corresponding closing tags
- Validate nested div structures before deployment
- Test clickable elements across different browsers
- Use browser developer tools to inspect rendered HTML

**Warning Signs:**
- Visible `</a>` tags in browser output indicate templating processing issues
- Non-functional click areas often result from malformed HTML structure

## CSS Interaction Patterns

### Pointer Events Management
**Critical Rule:** CSS `pointer-events: none` completely blocks all click functionality - use with extreme caution.

**Problem Pattern:**
```scss
.clickable-element * {
  pointer-events: none; // This blocks ALL click events on child elements
}
```

**Solution Pattern:**
```scss
.clickable-element {
  cursor: pointer;
  // Allow child elements to receive pointer events by default
  
  .non-interactive-child {
    pointer-events: none; // Only apply to specific elements that need it
  }
}
```

**Key Insight:** The `pointer-events: none` rule cascades to all child elements and completely prevents click functionality. Only use on specific elements that should not be interactive.

## Visual Design Principles

### Background Image Integration
**Pattern:** Multi-layer background approach with proper overlays creates professional, cinematic effects.

**Effective Implementation:**
```scss
.hero-section {
  background: 
    linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(0,0,0,0.7) 0%, rgba(0,0,0,0.4) 100%),
    url('background-image.jpg') center/cover no-repeat;
  
  // Ensure text readability with proper contrast
  color: white;
  text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.8);
}
```

**Benefits:** Creates immediate visual impact while maintaining text readability and professional appearance.

### Glass-morphism Effects
**Pattern:** Translucent cards with backdrop blur provide modern, premium feel.

**Implementation:**
```scss
.glass-card {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
  border-radius: 12px;
  box-shadow: 0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```

**Use Cases:** Statistics cards, overlay elements, modern UI components that need to stand out over background images.

### Typography for Impact
**Pattern:** Large, glowing text with proper contrast ensures readability and visual impact.

**Effective Approach:**
```scss
.hero-title {
  font-size: clamp(2rem, 5vw, 4rem);
  font-weight: 700;
  color: white;
  text-shadow: 
    2px 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.8),
    0 0 20px rgba(242, 203, 5, 0.3);
  
  // Responsive sizing ensures impact across devices
}
```

**Key Elements:** Responsive sizing, multiple text shadows for depth, brand color integration for consistency.

## Animation and Interaction Design

### Performance-Optimized Animations
**Pattern:** Use transform and opacity properties for smooth 60fps animations.

**Efficient Animation:**
```scss
.interactive-element {
  transition: transform 0.2s ease, opacity 0.2s ease;
  
  &:hover {
    transform: translateY(-2px) scale(1.02);
    opacity: 0.9;
  }
}
```

**Avoid:** Animating properties that trigger layout recalculation (width, height, margin, padding).

### Subtle Motion Principles
**Pattern:** Purposeful animations that enhance without distracting.

**Guidelines:**
- Duration: 0.2s for micro-interactions, 0.3s for larger movements
- Easing: `ease` or `ease-out` for natural feel
- Purpose: Every animation should serve a functional purpose
- Accessibility: Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` user preferences

## Community Website Specific Insights

### Newcomer Experience Design
**Pattern:** Balance epic scale presentation with approachable, welcoming messaging.

**Effective Approach:**
- Use dramatic visuals to show game's grandeur
- Immediately communicate that newcomers are welcome
- Provide multiple, clear pathways to join
- Include social proof through photos and community stories

**Key Messaging Balance:**
- "Epic 12-hour civilization building" + "No experience required!"
- "Up to 18 players" + "Friendly community will help you learn"
- "Strategic complexity" + "Designed to be learned as you play"

### Social Proof Integration
**Pattern:** Photos and community achievements build confidence in potential newcomers.

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Show real people having fun at events
- Display community growth statistics
- Highlight welcoming, inclusive atmosphere
- Include testimonials and success stories

### Multiple Engagement Pathways
**Pattern:** Different people prefer different ways to connect - provide options.

**Effective Options:**
- Discord for real-time chat and community
- Facebook for social media engagement
- Email signup for event notifications
- Direct event signup for immediate commitment

## Technical Architecture Insights

### Component-Based CSS Architecture
**Pattern:** Modular CSS components with consistent naming conventions improve maintainability.

**Naming Convention:**
```scss
.component-name {
  // Base component styles
  
  &--modifier {
    // Modifier variations
  }
  
  &__element {
    // Child element styles
  }
}
```

**Benefits:** Predictable styling, easy maintenance, reusable components, clear code organization.

### Mobile-First Responsive Design
**Pattern:** Design for mobile, enhance for desktop.

**Implementation:**
```scss
.component {
  // Mobile styles (base)
  padding: 1rem;
  font-size: 1rem;
  
  @media (min-width: 768px) {
    // Desktop enhancements
    padding: 2rem;
    font-size: 1.125rem;
  }
}
```

**Rationale:** Ensures excellent mobile experience while providing enhanced desktop features.
