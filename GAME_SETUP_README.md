2. **Discord Integration** - Generates Apollo commands for manual event creation
3. **Website Updates** - Automatically updates netlify.toml redirects
4. **Email Generation** - Creates personalized announcements from templates
5. **Email Distribution** - Sends announcements to subscribers

## Components

**Location:** Root directory

**Purpose:** Orchestrates the complete game setup workflow through an interactive bash script.

**Features:**
- Interactive prompts with smart defaults and validation
- Automatic game numbering based on existing posts
- Date validation and formatting (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Colorized output with emojis for better user experience
- Error handling and backup creation
- Confirmation steps before making changes

### 2. Email Template System

**Template:** `docs/emails/templates/email-game-announcement.html`
**Output:** `docs/emails/YYYY-MM-DD-email.html`

**Dynamic Replacements:**
- Game name and number
- Game date (formatted for display)
- Next game date (optional)
- Event details and logistics

### 3. Email Distribution (`send-mail.sh`)

**Location:** Root directory

**Purpose:** Handles the actual email sending to subscribers.

**Requirements:** Must be configured with appropriate email credentials and recipient list.

## Prerequisites

1. **Bash Shell** - macOS/Linux environment with bash
2. **Email System** - `send-mail.sh` script configured with email credentials
3. **Discord Access** - Ability to execute Apollo commands in the Discord server
4. **File Permissions** - Write access to netlify.toml and docs/emails directory

## Usage

### Running the Automation

```bash
./setup-new-game.sh
```

### Interactive Workflow

The script guides you through a 6-step process:

#### Step 1: Information Gathering
- **Game name**: Defaults to "Mega Empires: The West - Game X" with auto-incremented number
- **Game date**: YYYY-MM-DD format with validation
- **Next game date**: Optional, also validated if provided
- **Confirmation**: Review details before proceeding

#### Step 2: Apollo Command Generation
- Generates a properly formatted Discord `/event create` command
- Includes all event details (title, start/end times, max attendees, description)
- Command includes venue address, transit info, contact details, and cost

#### Step 3: Manual Discord Event Creation
- Copy the generated Apollo command
- Execute it in your Discord server
- Provide the resulting Discord event URL back to the script

#### Step 4: Website Redirect Update
- Automatically backs up current `netlify.toml`
- Updates the signup redirect to point to the new Discord event
- Redirect URL: `https://signup.torontomegaempires.com`

#### Step 5: Email Generation
- Creates a new email file: `docs/emails/YYYY-MM-DD-email.html`
- Uses the template and replaces placeholders with actual game details
- Formats dates for human-readable display

#### Step 6: Email Distribution
- Executes `./send-mail.sh` with the game name and email file
- Sends announcement to all subscribers

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites Setup

1. **Make script executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup-new-game.sh
   ```

2. **Configure email system:**
   - Ensure `send-mail.sh` is executable and properly configured
   - Test email sending functionality before running game setup

3. **Verify Discord access:**
   - Ensure you have permissions to create events in the Discord server
   - Test Apollo commands work in your Discord environment

### File Structure

The script expects this file structure:
```
/
├── setup-new-game.sh              # Main automation script
├── send-mail.sh                   # Email sending script
├── netlify.toml                   # Website configuration (will be updated)
└── docs/
    ├── emails/
    │   ├── templates/
    │   │   └── email-game-announcement.html  # Email template
    │   └── YYYY-MM-DD-email.html            # Generated emails
    └── _posts/
        └── *Game-*.markdown                  # Existing game posts (for numbering)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Date validation errors**: Ensure dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format
