# Three Ways to Play

## üè† Cozy Home Games
**Perfect for newcomers and veterans alike**

Four times a year in Toronto's Beaches neighborhood, we host intimate 9-player games that alternate between the Western and Eastern civilizations. These all-day sessions (10am-10pm) include lunch and dinner, creating the perfect environment for both epic gameplay and great conversation.

*Scheduled: End of February, May, September, and November*

## üèõÔ∏è Mega MiniCon
**The full experience with maximum players**

Twice yearly at The Guild House, we unleash the complete 18-player Mega Empires experience. This is strategy gaming at its most ambitious - a full day of civilization building with every nation in play simultaneously.

*January & June ‚Ä¢ $10 table fee per player*

## üé™ Convention Gaming
**Join us at gaming events**

We're regulars at the Niagara Boardgame Weekend, where Mega Empires has become a Thursday tradition. It's a great way to experience the game in a festival atmosphere surrounded by fellow board game enthusiasts.

# What Makes Mega Empires Special?

This isn't just any board game - it's a **gaming event**. Mega Empires evolved from the classic Civilization by Francis Tresham, expanded through years of passionate fan development. The result? An unparalleled strategy experience that balances:

- **Trade & Diplomacy**: Negotiate, form alliances, and broker deals
- **Civilization Building**: Develop technologies and advance your society  
- **Strategic Warfare**: When diplomacy fails, armies march
- **Epic Scale**: Games span millennia of human development
