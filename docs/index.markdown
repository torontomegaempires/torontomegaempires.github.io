## Welcome

Welcome to the home site of the Toronto Mega Empires group. We organize games of the biggest civilization building game ever made - supporting up to 18 players and taking 10 to 12 hours to play.

You can learn more about this epic event game by Collossus Games at [https://mega-empires.com](https://mega-empires.com)

## History of the game

Mega Empires was first released as Mega Civilization and was the culmination of years of fan work on the online CivProject to create an expanded version of the classic boargame Civilization by Francis Tresham. You can read all about the history of its development at at [https://mega-empires.com/history/](https://mega-empires.com/history/)

### Hosting your own game

We're always looking for more venues and locations to host a game of Mega Empires. If you know of one feel free to contact [rob@torontomegaempires.com](mailto:rob@torontomegaempires.com) who'll help you organize the game and find players. We're especially interested in venues in the GTA to better accommodate our out of town players.
