Here are the results of our last game. We played the Expert AST to round 16 (17 is the last round) and it is astounding how much richer everyone is when you play with the full 9 nations and the extra set of trade goods. Lots of people had tons of civilization advances.

And I finally won! :) I say it's because Allister wasn't playing.
