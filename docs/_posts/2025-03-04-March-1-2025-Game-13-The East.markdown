Here are the results of our last game. We played the Expert AST to round 18 and finished the game in 10 hours. As usual everyone is when you play with the full 9 nations and the extra set of trade goods. Lots of people had tons of civilization advances and even the last place player had over 100 points! I must say though that Maurya and Dravidia struggled hard against calamities. Note also the three-way tie for 6th place!

Congratulations to Don for emerging the clear winner. His Rhetoric strategy really paid off. Please also take a moment to appreciate just how nice the new playmat is to play on.

I also want to thank Stephanie and Cédric for making the drive from Gatineau to come play. We hope to see you again in Toronto another time!

Don and John P. pulled ahead of everyone else in the mid-game. John C. was doing well at first, but then got clobbered by calamities.
